This repository contains my personal website and online resume for **GEOG 458 – Digital Geographies** at the University of Washington.

The site is built using **GitHub Pages**, **Markdown**, and a **Bootstrap 5 template** from Start Bootstrap. It serves as a space to practice web development skills, project management with GitHub, and explore the relationship between space, technology, and society.

## Contents
- `index.html` – Main website homepage
- `resume.md` – Online resume published via GitHub Pages
